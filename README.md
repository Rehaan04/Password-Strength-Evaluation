# Password-Strength-Evaluation
The Objective of this project is to understand what makes a password strong and to test it against password strength tools.

# Steps Followed
1) Created a few password samples with varying complexity:
   a) Password121:Very Weak
   b) Password$#1:Weak
   c) Pord1!$2:Moderate
   d) Pass#$23$%67*&:Strong
   e) P@word45^34@12&:Very Strong
2) Tested each Password on a Password Strength Checker Tool (PasswordMonster.com) which shows complexity as well as the time it took to crack the password:
   a) Password121 : Very Weak : 0.09 seconds
   b) Password$#1 : Weak : 3.61 seconds
   c) Pord1!$2 : Medium : 4 days
   d) Pass#$23$%67*& : Strong : 9 years
   e) P@word45^34@12& : Very Strong : 75 thousand years
3) Identified best practices for creating strong passwords such as
   a) using more than 12 characters
   b) including uppercase,lowercase,numbers and special characters
   c) avoiding using dictionary words and not reusing passwords
4) Researched common password attacks such as
   a) Brute Force attacks-Tries every possible combination
   b) Dictionary attacks- Uses a list of common passwords
   c) Phishing- Tricks users into revealing their passwords

 # Summary
 -Complexity and Length increases password cracking time.
 -It is always better to use different long and random passwords for different sites.
